# This Django project is compatible with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

# This is an unbeatable tic-tac-toe game that runs on a locally hosted web app. It's gui is very simple, and will run on modern browsers.
# The logic for the game is entirely in the tictactoe.py module, and is based of numpy. It allows for every
# possible move by the human and computer, so long as the human does not win.

# FIRST: to install all dependencies and get up and running, execute

sh virtualenv_install

# Then activate the virtualenv by executing

source ~/.virtualenvs/Tic-Tac-Toe/bin/activate

# With the virtualenv activated, you can install the rest of the dependencies, and run the app

sh install_requirements.sh
